# ha-bridge
Emulates Philips Hue api to other home automation gateways such as an Amazon Echo.  The Bridge handles basic commands such as "On", "Off" and "brightness" commands of the hue protocol.  This bridge can control most devices that have a distinct API.

In the cases of systems that require authorization and/or have API's that cannot be handled in the current method, a module may need to be built. The Harmony Hub is such a module and so is the Nest module. The Bridge has helpers to build devices for the gateway for the Logitech Harmony Hub, Vera, Vera Lite or Vera Edge, Nest and the ability to proxy all of your real Hue bridges behind this bridge.

Alternatively the Bridge supports custom calls as well using http/https/udp and tcp such as the LimitlessLED/MiLight bulbs using the UDP protocol. Binary data is supported with UDP/TCP.

This bridge was built to help put the Internet of Things together.
## Build
To customize and build it yourself, build a new jar with maven:  

ATTENTION: This requires JDK 1.8 to build

```
mvn install
```
Otherwise, downloads are available at https://github.com/bwssytems/ha-bridge/releases.  
## Run
Then locate the jar and start the server with:  

ATTENTION: This requires JDK 1.8 to run

```
java -jar ha-bridge-W.X.Y.jar
```
### Automation on Linux systems
To have this conigured and running automatically ther eare a few resources to use. One is using Docker and a docker containerahs been built for this and can be gotten here: https://github.com/aptalca/docker-ha-bridge

For next gen Linux systems, here is a systemctl unit file that you can install. Here is a link on how to do this: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units
```
[Unit]
Description=HA Bridge
Wants=network.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar -Dconfig.file=/home/pi/amazon-echo/data/habridge.config /home/pi/amazon-echo/ha-bridge-2.0.0.jar

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
## Available Arguments
Arguments are now deprecated. The ha-bridge will use the old -D arguments and populate the configuration screen, Brisge Control Tab, which can now be saved to a file and will not be needed. There is only one optional argument that overrides and that is the location of the configuration file. The default is the relative path "data/habridge.config".
### -Dconfig.file=`<filepath>`
The default location for the configuration file to contain the settings for the bridge is the relative path from where the bridge is started in "data/habridge.config". If you would like a different filename or directory, specify -Dconfig.file=`<directory>/<filename>` explicitly. The command line example:
```
java -jar -Dconfig.file=/home/me/data/myhabridge.config ha-bridge-W.X.Y.jar
```
### -Dserver.port=`<port number>`
The default port number for the bridge is 8080. To override what the default or what is in the configuration file for this parameter, specify -Dserver.port=`<port number>` explicitly. This is especially helpful if you are running the ha-bridge for the first time and have another application on port 8080. The command line example:
```
java -jar -Dserver.port=80 ha-bridge-W.X.Y.jar
```

## HA Bridge Usage and Configuration
This section will cover the basics of configuration and where this configuration can be done. This requires that you have started your bridge process and then have pointed your
favorite web interface by going to the http://<my ip address>:<port> or http://localhost:<port> with port you have assigned. The default quick link is http://localhost:8080 for yoru reference.
### The Bridge Devices Tab
This screen allows you to see your devices you have configured for the ha-bridge to present to a controller, such as an Amazon Echo/Dot. It gives you a count of devices as there have been reports that the Echo only supports a limited number, but has been growing as of late, YMMV. You can test each device from this page as this calls the ha-bridge just as a controller would, i.e. the Echo. This is useful to make sure your configuration for each device is correct and for trouble shooting. You can also manages your devices as well by editing and making a new device copy as well as deleting it.

At the bottom of the screen is the "Bridge Device DB Backup" which can be accessed with clicking on the `+` to expand this frame. Here you can backup and restore configurations that you have saved. These configs can be named or by clicking the `Backup Device DB' button will create a backup and name it for you. You can manage these backups by restoring them or deleting them.
### The Bridge Control Tab
This is where all of the configuration occurs for what ports and IP's the bridge runs on. It also contains the configurations for target devices so that Helper Tabs for configuration can be added as well as the connection information to control those devices.
#### Bridge server
This field is used to test the bridge server with the UPNP IP Address and to make sure that the bridge is responding.
#### Bridge Control Buttons
These buttons are for managing the bridge. The Save button is enabled when there is a change to the configuration. The Bridge Reinitialize button will recycle the internal running of the bridge in the java process. The Stop button will stop the java process. The Refresh button will refresh the page and settings.
#### Configuration Path and File
The default location for the configuration file to contain the settings for the bridge is the relative path from where the bridge is started in "data/habridge.config". If you would like a different filename or directory, specify `<directory>/<filename>` explicitly.
#### Device DB Path and File
The default location for the db to contain the devices as they are added is "data/devices.db". If you would like a different filename or directory, specify `<directory>/<filename>  explicitly.
#### UPNP IP Address
The server defaults to the first available address on the host if this is not given. This default may NOT be the correct IP that is your public IP for your host on the network. It is best to set this parameter to not have discovery issues. Replace this value with the server ipv4 address you would like to use as the address that any upnp device will call after discovery. 
#### Web Server Port
The server defaults to running on port 8080. To override what the default is, specify a different number.
#### UPNP Response Port
The upnp response port that will be used. The default is 50000.  
#### Vera Names and IP Addresses
Provide IP Addresses of your Veras that you want to utilize with the bridge. Also, give a meaningful name to each one so it is easy to decipher in the helper tab. When these names and IP's are given, the bridge will be able to control the devices or scenes by the call it receives and send it to the target Vera and devce/scene you configure. 
#### Harmony Names and IP Addresses
Provide IP Addresses of your Harmony Hubs that you want to utilize with the bridge. Also, give a meaningful name to each one so it is easy to decipher in the helper tab. When these names and IP's are given, the bridge will be able to control the activity or buttons by the call it receives and send it to the target Harmony Hub and activity/button you configure. 
#### Harmony Username
The user name of the MyHarmony.com account for the Harmony Hub. This needs to be given if you are using the Harmony Hub features.
#### Harmony Password
The password for the user name of the MyHarmony.com account for the Harmony Hub. This needs to be given if you are using the Harmony Hub Features.
#### Hue Names and IP Addresses
Provide IP Addresses of your Hue Bridges that you want to proxy through the bridge. Also, give a meaningful name to each one so it is easy to decipher in the helper tab. When these names and IP's are given, the bridge will passthru the call it receives to the target Hue and device you configure.

Don't forget - You will need to push the link button when you got to the Hue Tab the first time ater the process comes up.  (The user name is not persistent when the process comes up.)
#### Nest Username
The user name of the home.nest.com account for the Nest user. This needs to be given if you are using the Nest features. There is no need to give any ip address or host information as this contacts your cloud account.
#### Nest Password
The password for the user name of the home.nest.com account for the Nest user. This needs to be given if you are using the Nest features.
#### Nest Temp Farenheit
This setting allows the value being sent into the bridge to be interpreted as Farenheit or Celsius. The default is to have Farenheit.
#### Button Press/Call Item Loop Sleep Interval (ms)
This setting is the time used in between button presses when there is multple buttons in a button device. It also controls the time between multiple items in a custom device call. This is defaulted to 100ms and the number represnts milliseonds (1000 milliseconds = 1 second).
#### Log Messages to Buffer
This controls how many log messages will be kept and displayed on the log tab. This does not affect what is written to the standard output for logging. The default is 512. Changing this will incur more memory usage of the process.
#### UPNP Strict Handling
Upnp has been set to be very specific as to respond as a Hue. There may be a need to make this response a little more open for other devices that may want to find the ha-bridge. The default is to be strict which is set as true.
#### Trace UPNP Calls
Turn on tracing for upnp discovery messages to the log. The default is false.

At the bottom of the screen is the "Bridge Settings Backup" which can be accessed with clicking on the `+` to expand this frame. Here you can backup and restore configurations that you have saved. These configs can be named or by clicking the `Backup Settings' button will create a backup and name it for you. You can manage these backups by restoring them or deleting them.
### The Logs Tab
This screen displays the last 512 or number of rows defined in the config screen of the log so you don't have to go to the output of your process. The `Update Log` button refreshes the log as this screen does not auto refresh. FYI, when the trace upnp setting is turned on in the configuration, the messages will show here.

The bottom part of the Logs Screen has configuration to change the logging levels as it is running. The ROOT is the basic setting and will turn on only top level logging. To set logging at a lower level, select the `Show All Loggers` checkbox and then you can set the explicit level on each of the processes components. The most helpful logger would be setting DBUG for com.bwssystems.HABridge.hue.HueMulator component. Changing this and then selecting the `Update Log Levels` button applies the new log settings. 
### Bridge Device Additions
You must configure devices before you will have any thing for the Echo or other contoller that is connected to the ha-bridge to receive.
#### Helpers
The easy way to get devices configured is with the use of the helpers for the Vera or Harmony, Nest and Hue to create devices that the bridge will present.

For the Helpers, each item being presented from the target system has a button such as `Generate Bridge Device`, `Build A Button` or specific tasks such as `Temp` for thermostats that is used to create the specific device parameters and give it a name in the "Add a Bridge Device..." area below. The next thing to check is the name for the bridge device that it is something that makes sense especially if you usign the ha-bridge with an Echo as this is what the Echo will interpret as the device you want. Then select the `Add Bridge Device` button to finalize it.

The helper tabs will also show you what you have already configured for that target type. Click on the `+` and you will see them and be able to delete them.
#### The Manual Add Tab
Another way to add a device is through the Manual Add Tab. This allows you to manually enter the name, the on and off URLs and select if there are custom handling with the type of call that can be made. This allows for control of anything that has a distinct request that can be executed so you are not limited to the Vera, Harmony, Nest or other Hue.

The format of these can be the default HTTP request which executes the URLs formatted as `http://<your stuff here>` as a GET. Other options to this are to select the HTTP Verb and add the data type and add a body that is passed with the request. Secure https is supported as well, just use `https://<your secure call here>`. When using POST and PUT, you have the ability to specify the body that will be sent with the request as well as the application type for the http call.

Headers can be added as well using a Json construct [{"name":"header type name","value":"the header value"}] with the format example:
```
[{"name":"Cache-Control","value":"no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"},
{"name":"Pragma","value":"no-cache"}]
```

Another option that is detected by the bridge is to use UDP or TCP direct calls such as `udp://<ip_address>:<port>/<your stuff here>` to send a UDP request. TCP calls are handled the same way as `tcp://<ip_address>:<port>/<your stuff here>`. If your data for the UDP or TCP request is formatted as "0x00F009B9" lexical hex format, the bridge will convert the data into a binary stream to send.

You can also use the value replacement constructs within these statements. Such as using the expressions ${intensity.percent} for 0-100 or ${intensity.byte} for 0-255 for straight pass through of the value or items that require special calculated values using ${intensity.math()} i.e. "${intensity.math(X/4)}".
Examples:
```
GET
http://192.168.1.1:8180/set/this/value/${intensity.percent}

PUT
http://192.168.1.1:8280/set/this
ContentBody: {"someValue":"${intensity..byte}"}

udp://192.168.1.1:5000/0x45${intensity.percent}55

udp://192.168.2.2:6000/fireoffthismessage\n

tcp://192.168.3.3:9000/sendthismessage

tcp://192.168.4.4:10000/0x435f12dd${intensity.math((X -4)*50)}438c

tcp://192.168.5.5:110000/0x
```

#### Multiple Call Construct
Also available is the ability to specify multiple commands in the On URL, Dim URL and Off URL areas by adding Json constructs listed here.
Format Example in the URL areas:
```
[{"item":"http://192.168.1.1:8180/do/this/thing"},
{"item":"http://192.168.1.1:8180/do/the/next/thing"},
"item":"http://192.168.1.1:8180/do/another/thing"}]


[{"item":"udp://192.168.1.1:5000/0x450555"},
{"item":"udp://192.168.1.1:5000/0x45${intensity.percent}55"}]

[{"item":"udp://192.168.1.1:5000/0x450555"},
{"item":"http://192.168.1.1:8180/do/this/thing"},
{"item":"tcp://192.168.2.1/sendthisdata"},
{"item":"https://192.168.12.1/do/this/secure/thing"}]
```
#### Script or Command Execution
The release as of v2.0.0 will now support the execution of a local script or program. This will blindly fire off a process to run and is bound by the privileges of the java process.

To configure this type of manual add, you will need to select the Device type of "Execute Script/Program".

In the URL areas, the format of the execution is just providing what command line you would like to run, or using the multiple call item construct described above.
```
notepad.exe

OR

[{"item":"C:\\Users\\John\\Documents\\Applications\\putty.exe 192.168.1.1"},
{"item":"notepad.exe"}]

OR

/home/me/startsomething.sh

```

Also, you may want to use the REST API's listed below to configure your devices.
## Ask Alexa
After this Tell Alexa: "Alexa, discover my devices". If there is an issue you can go to the `Menu / Settings / Connected Home` for the echo on the mobile app or your browser and have Alexa forget all devices and then do the discovery again.

Then you can say "Alexa, Turn on the office light" or whatever name you have given your configured devices.  

Here is the table of items to use to tell Alexa what you want to do:

To do this... |	Say this...
--------------|------------
ON Commands | 
 | Alexa, turn on `<Device Name>`
 | Alexa, start `<Device Name>`
 | Alexa, unlock `<Device Name>`
 | Alexa, open `<Device Name>`
 | Alexa, boot up `<Device Name>`
 | Alexa, run `<Device Name>`
 | Alexa, arm `<Device Name>`
OFF Commands | 
 | Alexa, turn off `<Device Name>`
 | Alexa, stop `<Device Name>` (this one is tricky to get right)
 | Alexa, stop running `<Device Name>` (also very tricky)
 | Alexa, lock `<Device Name>`
 | Alexa, close `<Device Name>`
 | Alexa, shutdown `<Device Name>`
 | Alexa, shut `<Device Name>`
 | Alexa, disarm `<Device Name>`
DIM Commands | 
 | Alexa, brighten `<Device Name>` to `<Position>`
 | Alexa, dim `<Device Name> to <Position>`
 | Alexa, raise `<Device Name>` to `<Position>`
 | Alexa, lower `<Device Name>` to `<Position>`
 | Alexa, set `<Device Name>` to `<Position>`
 | Alexa, turn up `<Device Name>` to `<Position>`
 | Alexa, turn down `<Device Name>` to `<Position>`

To see what Alexa thinks you said, you can check in the home page for your alexa.

To view or remove devices that Alexa knows about, you can use the mobile app `Menu / Settings / Connected Home` or go to http://echo.amazon.com/#cards.
## Configuration REST API Usage
This section will describe the REST api available for configuration. The REST body examples are all formatted for easy reading, the actual body usage should be like this:
```
{"var1":"value1","var2":"value2","var3:"value3"}
```
The body should be all in one string and not separated by returns, tabs or spaces. FYI, GET items do not require a body element.  If you would like to see example return of json data for full Harmony Hub configuration if configured, which includes activities and devices, take a look at the resource file config.data. If you are interested in how the json data looks for the HA bridge configuration, after creating a device, look at the data directory for the device.db.
These calls can be accomplished with a REST tool using the following URLs and HTTP Verb types:
### Add a device 
Add a new device to the HA Bridge configuration. There is a basic examples and then three alternate examples for the add. Please note that dimming is supported as well as custom value based on the dimming number given from the echo. This is under the Dimming and Value example.
```
POST http://host:8080/api/devices
```
#### Body Arguments
Name |	Type |	Description | Required
-----|-------|--------------|------------
name | string | A name for the device. This is also the utterance value that the Echo will use. | Required
mapId | string | This identifies the id of the source items config and used by the ui to sort what has been configured | Optional
mapType | string | This identifies what type of source item was used from the helper | Optional
deviceType | string | This identifies what type of device entry this is. It is used by the system and should be the values of "switch", "scene", "custom", "activity", "button", "thermo", "passthru", "exec", "UDP", "TCP" or "custom". | Required
targetDevice | string | A name given to the target when there are multiples of a given type in the configuration | Optional
onUrl | string | This is the URL or Data Description that is executed for an "on" request. | Required
dimUrl | string | This is the URL or Data Description that is executed for an "on" request when a intensity value is sent. | Optional
offUrl | string | This is the URL or Data Description that is executed for an "off" request. | Optional
headers | string | This is a header or list of headers that is used for http/https calls when given. | Optional
httpVerb | string | This is used for "custom" calls that the user would like to execute. The values can only be "GET, "PUT", "POST". | Optional

#### Basic Example
```
{
"name" : "bedroom light",
"deviceType" : "switch",
  "onUrl" : "http://192.168.1.201:3480/data_request?id=action&output_format=json&serviceId=urn:upnp-org:serviceId:SwitchPower1&action=SetTarget&newTargetValue=1&DeviceNum=41",
  "offUrl" : "http://192.168.1.201:3480/data_request?id=action&output_format=json&serviceId=urn:upnp-org:serviceId:SwitchPower1&action=SetTarget&newTargetValue=0&DeviceNum=41"
}
```
#### Dimming Control Example
Dimming is also supported by using the expressions ${intensity.percent} for 0-100 or ${intensity.byte} for 0-255 for straight pass trhough of the value.
e.g.
```
{
    "name": "entry light",
    "deviceType": "switch",
    "offUrl": "http://192.168.1.201:3480/data_request?id=action&output_format=json&serviceId=urn:upnp-org:serviceId:SwitchPower1&action=SetTarget&newTargetValue=0&DeviceNum=31",
    "onUrl": "http://192.168.1.201:3480/data_request?id=action&output_format=json&DeviceNum=31&serviceId=urn:upnp-org:serviceId:Dimming1&action=SetLoadLevelTarget&newLoadlevelTarget=${intensity.percent}"
}
```
See the echo's documentation for the dimming phrase.

#### Value Passing Control Example
You can control items that require special calculated values using ${intensity.math(<your expression using "X" as the value to operate on>)} i.e. "${intensity.math(X/4)}".    
e.g.
```
{
    "name": "Thermostat,
    "deviceType": "custom",
    "offUrl": "http://192.168.1.201:3480/data_request?id=action&output_format=json&serviceId=urn:upnp-org:serviceId:SwitchPower1&action=SetTarget&newTargetValue=0&DeviceNum=10",
    "onUrl": "http://192.168.1.201:3480/data_request?id=action&output_format=json&DeviceNum=10&serviceId=urn:upnp-org:serviceId:Dimming1&action=SetLoadLevelTarget&newLoadlevelTarget=${intensity.math(X/4)}"
}
```
See the echo's documentation for the dimming phrase.

#### POST/PUT Support Example
```
This will allow control of any other application that may need more then GET.  You can also use the dimming and value control commands within the URLs as well.
e.g: 
{
    "name": "test device",
    "deviceType": "custom",
    "offUrl": "http://192.168.1.201:3480/data_request?id=action&output_format=json&serviceId=urn:upnp-org:serviceId:SwitchPower1&action=SetTarget&newTargetValue=0&DeviceNum=31",
    "onUrl": "http://192.168.1.201:3480/data_request?id=action&output_format=json&DeviceNum=31&serviceId=urn:upnp-org:serviceId:Dimming1&action=SetLoadLevelTarget&newLoadlevelTarget=${intensity.percent}",
  "httpVerb":"POST",
  "contentType" : "application/json",
  "contentBody" : "{\"fooBar\":\"baz_on\"}"
  "contentBodyOff" : "{\"fooBar\":\"baz_off\"}"
}
```
#### Custom Usage URLs Example
Anything that takes an action as a result of an HTTP request will probably work and you can also use the dimming and value control commands within the URLs as well - like putting Vera in and out of night mode:  
```
{
  "name": "night mode",
  "deviceType": ""custom",
  "offUrl": "http://192.168.1.201:3480/data_request?id=lu_action&serviceId=urn:micasaverde-com:serviceId:HomeAutomationGateway1&action=SetHouseMode&Mode=1",
  "onUrl": "http://192.168.1.201:3480/data_request?id=lu_action&serviceId=urn:micasaverde-com:serviceId:HomeAutomationGateway1&action=SetHouseMode&Mode=3"
}
```
Here is a UDP example that can send binary data.
```
{
  "name": "UDPPacket",
  "deviceType": "custom",
  "offUrl": "udp://192.168.1.1:8899/0x460055",
  "onUrl": "udp://192.168.1.1:8899/0x450055"
}
```

### Set light state
Allows the user to turn the light on and off, modify the brightness.
```
PUT	http://host:port/api/<username>/lights/<id>/state
```
#### Body arguments
Name |	Type |	Description	 
-----|-------|-------------
on |	bool |	On/Off state of the light. On=true, Off=false. Optional
bri |	uint8 |	The brightness value to set the light to. Brightness is a scale from 1 (the minimum the light is capable of) to 254 (the maximum). Note: a brightness of 1 is not off. e.g. "brightness": 60 will set the light to a specific brightness. Optional
```
{
	"on": true,
	"bri": 200
}
```
#### Response
A response to a successful PUT request contains confirmation of the arguments passed in. Note: If the new value is too large to return in the response due to internal memory constraints then a value of "Updated." is returned.
```
[

	{"success":{"/lights/1/state/on":true}},
]
```
### Update bridge internal light state
Allows the user to set the internal state of the light on and off, modify the brightness. This is not a HUE API call and is special to the bridge as it keeps track of the state changes to the light from the api. It is intended to allow you to sync the bridge state with your HA system state.
```
PUT	http://host:port/api/<username>/lights/<id>/bridgeupdatestate
```
#### Body arguments
These are examples that can be used in the control of items iwthin the bridge, but for HUE passthru devices, the complete state object is sent.

## UPNP Emulation of HUE
This section will discuss the UPNP implementation of this bridge based as much as can be for the HUE.
### UPNP listening
The HA Bridge default UPNP listner is started on port 1900 on the upnp multicast address of 239.255.255.250. All ethernet interfaces that are active are bound to and the repsonse port is set to the one given on the command line above or the default of 50000.

The listener will respond to the following body packet that contain the following minimal information:

```
M-SEARCH * HTTP/1.1\r\n
MAN: "ssdp:discover"\r\n
ST: urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:basic:1\r\n
	OR
ST: upnp:rootdevice\r\n
	OR
ST: ssdp:all\r\n
```

If this criteria is met, the following response is provided to the calling application:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
CACHE-CONTROL: max-age=86400\r\n
EXT:\r\n
LOCATION: http://192.168.1.1:8080/description.xml\r\n
SERVER: FreeRTOS/6.0.5, UPnP/1.0, IpBridge/0.1\r\n 
ST: urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:basic:1\r\n
"USN: uuid:Socket-1_0-221438K0100073::urn:schemas-upnp-org:device:basic:1\r\n\r\n
```
### UPNP description service
The bridge provides the description service which is used by the calling app to interogate access details after it has decided the upnp multicast repsonse is the correct device.
#### Get Description
```
GET http://host:8080/description.xml
```

## Debugging
To turn on debugging for the bridge, use the following extra parm in the command line:
```
-Dorg.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel=DEBUG
```
## Development Mode
To turn on development mode so that it will not need an Harmony Hub for testing, use the following extra parm in the command line and the harmony ip and login info will not be needed:
```
java -jar -Ddev.mode=true ha-bridge-0.X.Y.jar
```
